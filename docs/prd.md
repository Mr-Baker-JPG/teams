# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project:** Open-Source Team & Club Management Platform **Prepared By:**
Product Manager (Alex üëî, BMAD Persona)

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

**Purpose:** The purpose of this project is to provide schools and community
organizations with a free, ad-free, open-source team management platform. The
product solves two core problems:

1. Existing solutions are either unaffordable or supported by inappropriate
   advertising.
2. Current tools are bloated with features schools don‚Äôt need.

This platform will deliver the essential workflows ‚Äî scheduling, roster
management, availability tracking, and communication ‚Äî in a way that is safe,
reliable, and extensible.

**Scope (V1):**

- ‚úÖ In Scope:
  - Team & roster management
  - Scheduling (practices, games, events)
  - Availability tracking
  - Messaging & announcements
  - Notifications (basic email + PWA push)
  - Multi-team support
  - Self-hosting setup (SQLite, Docker, documentation)

- ‚ùå Out of Scope (V1):
  - Payments, fundraising, sponsorship features
  - Coaching/training modules
  - Media galleries
  - Statistics, analytics, or performance tracking
  - Full-scale mobile apps (beyond PWA support)
  - Support for non-school community leagues (deferred to V2)

---

## 2. Objectives & Success Criteria

**Objectives:**

1. Deliver a functional MVP supporting rosters, scheduling, availability
   tracking, and messaging.
2. Ensure the platform is **ad-free and free forever**, enforced by licensing.
3. Provide a self-hosting path (SQLite + Docker + docs) usable by basic IT
   staff.
4. Launch with at least **one pilot school** actively using the system.
5. Prepare an optional managed hosting option for schools lacking IT capacity.

**Success Criteria (V1 Launch):**

- **Adoption:** At least 1 pilot school actively using all four core workflows.
- **Functionality:** All ‚ÄúLaunch Blocker‚Äù features achieve **95%+ test pass
  rate**.
- **Usability:** Core tasks (create roster, schedule events, send announcements)
  achievable within **3 clicks** from dashboard.
- **Hosting:** Docker deployment successfully tested by a non-developer.
- **Community Engagement:** At least 1 external contributor PR merged
  pre-launch.

   Ad‚ÄëFree Covenant and Trademark Policy. Third parties may operate forks or

**Assumptions:**

1. Schools have minimal IT staff or volunteers capable of Docker setup.
2. Some schools will require optional managed hosting.
3. Roster, scheduling, and messaging are primary workflows.
4. Community will extend platform via OSS contributions.
