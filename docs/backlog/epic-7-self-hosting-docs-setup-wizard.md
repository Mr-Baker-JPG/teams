# Epic 7: Self-Hosting Docs & Setup Wizard

Tasks:

- Docker Compose works out‑of‑box with `.env.example`; health endpoints exposed
  (`/healthz`, `/readyz`).
- Setup wizard creates org + admin user; validates email provider configuration.
- Self-hosting guide validated by non-developer; feedback loop captured.
