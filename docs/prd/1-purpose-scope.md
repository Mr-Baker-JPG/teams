# 1. Purpose & Scope

**Purpose:** The purpose of this project is to provide schools and community
organizations with a free, ad-free, open-source team management platform. The
product solves two core problems:

1. Existing solutions are either unaffordable or supported by inappropriate
   advertising.
2. Current tools are bloated with features schools don’t need.

This platform will deliver the essential workflows — scheduling, roster
management, availability tracking, and communication — in a way that is safe,
reliable, and extensible.

**Scope (V1):**

- ✅ In Scope:
  - Team & roster management
  - Scheduling (practices, games, events)
  - Availability tracking
  - Messaging & announcements
  - Notifications (basic email + PWA push)
  - Multi-team support
  - Self-hosting setup (SQLite, Docker, documentation)

- ❌ Out of Scope (V1):
  - Payments, fundraising, sponsorship features
  - Coaching/training modules
  - Media galleries
  - Statistics, analytics, or performance tracking
  - Full-scale mobile apps (beyond PWA support)
  - Support for non-school community leagues (deferred to V2)
