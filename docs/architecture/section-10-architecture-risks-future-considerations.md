# Section 10 â€” Architecture Risks & Future Considerations

**Risks:**

- SQLite scalability limits.
- Notification delivery dependency on Resend/Web Push.
- Self-hosting complexity for low-tech schools.
- Security vulnerabilities in OSS.
- Community contribution drift from principles.

**Future Considerations:**

- Migration path to Postgres for scale.
- Plugin ecosystem and integration APIs.
- Multi-tenant hosting for V2+.
- Native mobile wrappers.
- SIS/directory integrations.
- Advanced compliance (HIPAA, COPPA).
- Richer observability (metrics pipelines) while avoiding tracking/ads.
