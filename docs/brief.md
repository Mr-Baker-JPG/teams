# Project Brief: Open-Source Team & Club Management Platform

### Executive Summary

**Project Concept:** An open-source team and club management platform modeled
after TeamSnap, built on modern web technologies, without the
payment/fundraising and coach-training features.

**Problem Solved:** Current team management platforms create barriers for
schools and community organizations. Paid subscriptions put software out of
reach for some programs, while “free” versions often inject unwanted or even
offensive ads — unacceptable in youth and educational settings.

**Target Market:** Schools, community sports teams, recreational leagues, and
grassroots organizations with a bit of technical know-how who want to self-host
or deploy a clean, safe, and reliable alternative.

**Key Value Proposition:** A free, **ad-free**, open-source platform that
delivers the core features teams actually need — scheduling, roster management,
availability tracking, and communication — without financial burden or exposure
to inappropriate advertising. Designed for easy customization and self-hosting,
it empowers schools and clubs to take full control of their team management.

### Problem Statement

**Current State & Pain Points:**

- **High Costs:** Most comprehensive team management platforms (e.g., TeamSnap,
  SportsEngine) require ongoing subscriptions.
- **Unwanted/Offensive Ads:** Free tiers rely on ads that are distracting,
  inappropriate, and unsafe in educational/youth contexts.
- **Overcomplicated Features:** Many solutions bundle fundraising, sponsorship,
  and training modules that smaller organizations don’t need.
- **Lack of Control:** Proprietary platforms prevent customization and lock
  organizations into vendor ecosystems.

**Impact:**

- Schools and clubs rely on clunky spreadsheets, group texts, or emails, leading
  to missed practices and poor coordination.
- Ads in “free” versions risk exposing students and families to inappropriate
  content, raising liability and reputational concerns.
- Cost barriers limit equitable access — wealthier programs can afford tools,
  while underfunded ones are left behind.

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**

- Paid versions are unaffordable for many schools.
- Free versions are ad-driven, undermining trust and suitability in education.
- Open-source alternatives exist but are outdated, incomplete, or not
  youth-focused.

**Urgency:** As schools adopt digital tools under tighter budgets and stricter
safety expectations, a **trusted, ad-free, cost-free solution** is needed now.

### Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:** A lightweight, open-source platform delivering essentials —
rosters, scheduling, availability, communication — without ads, paywalls, or
unnecessary complexity.

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Ad-Free by Design:** Advertising is permanently excluded as a core
  principle.
- **Free Forever (Official):** The official project will remain free and
  ad‑free. Licensed under **AGPL‑3.0‑or‑later**; third parties may offer paid
  services/forks, but may not use our marks on ad‑supported distributions (see
  Ad‑Free Covenant and Trademark Policy).
- **Transparent Monetization:** If monetized, revenue comes only from optional
  hosting services.
- **Focused Feature Set:** No fundraising, sponsorship, or training modules.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built on Epic Stack + React Router v7 for
  extensibility.

**High-Level Vision:** A safe, community-driven platform where schools and clubs
manage teams without financial strain or exposure to offensive advertising. A
plugin ecosystem and community contributions will expand functionality while
keeping the core lean, stable, and ad-free.

### Target Users

**Primary User Segment: Schools and Educational Organizations**

- **Profile:** K–12 schools, after-school programs, and small colleges with IT
  staff or volunteers.
- **Pain Points:** Costly subscriptions, unwanted ads, bloated features.
- **Goals:** Centralized schedules, safe ad-free environment, zero software
  cost, flexible hosting.

**Secondary User Segment (Future/V2): Community Sports & Recreation Leagues**

- **Profile:** Local youth leagues, church/community clubs, adult rec leagues.
- **Pain Points:** Ads in free apps, cost of paid apps, fragmented
  communications.
- **Goals:** Affordable, ad-free team management with simple onboarding.

**Scope Decision:** V1 focuses on **schools only**; community/rec leagues are
deferred to **V2**.

### Goals & Success Metrics

**Primary Goals:**

- Deliver a **free, ad-free, open-source** school team management platform.
- Provide core features (scheduling, rosters, availability, messaging).
- Ensure schools can adopt without financial burden or unsafe ads.

**Secondary Goals:**

- Enable extensibility (plugins, add-ons).
- Foster a contributor community.
- Provide optional managed hosting.

**Success Metrics (V1):**

- 3–5 pilot schools using platform within year one.
- 80%+ of users report improved coordination vs. prior tools.
- 99% uptime for hosted deployments.
- \$500+ annual savings per school vs. commercial alternatives.
- At least 5 external OSS contributors engaged in first year.

### Core Features (Prioritized V1 Scope)

**Launch Blockers (MVP must-have):**

1. Team & roster management
2. Scheduling (practices, games, events)
3. Availability tracking
4. Messaging & announcements

**Important but Can Slip (Still V1):** 5\. Notifications (email, PWA push) 6\.
Multi-team support 7\. Self-hosting friendly setup & docs

**V2+ (Future Expansion):**

- Mobile app wrappers
- Media sharing
- Integrations (school directory, SIS)
- Stats & reports
- Community league workflows

---

### Risks & Challenges

**Technical:** Self-hosting complexity, messaging reliability, scaling issues.
**Adoption:** Change resistance, lack of support perception, slow community
traction. **Legal:** Licensing clarity, student data compliance (FERPA, GDPR),
enforcing ad-free principle. **Resource:** Scope creep, limited contributors,
hosting burden.

---

### Stakeholders & Roles

**Internal (BMAD Roles):** Analyst (Mary), Product Manager (Alex), Architect
(Sam), Developers, UX Expert (Taylor), QA Engineer (Jordan), Scrum Master
(Riley), Product Owner (Chris).

**External:**

- Schools (primary users, feedback providers)
- Parents/Guardians (secondary users)
- Community contributors (OSS devs)
- Hosting customers (future revenue source)

**Governance:** Community-driven, but core maintainers enforce principles
(ad-free, free-forever licensing).

---

### Roadmap & Timeline (Flexible Phases)

- **Phase 1:** Discovery & setup (docs, repo, license, architecture).
- **Phase 2:** Core MVP build (rosters, scheduling, availability, messaging).
- **Phase 3:** MVP launch (notifications, multi-team support, early hosting).
- **Phase 4:** Stability & community growth (security, governance, plugin API).
- **Phase 5:** V2 expansion (community leagues, media, integrations).

---

### Conclusion & Call to Action

This project addresses a clear gap: schools and clubs need safe, reliable team
management without the cost or risks of ads. By delivering a **free, ad-free,
open-source platform**, we ensure every organization can manage its teams with
trust and transparency.

The vision is for schools to adopt first, with community leagues to follow in
V2. Developers and contributors are invited to join the effort, shaping a
platform where **affordability, safety, and community ownership** define the
future of team management.
